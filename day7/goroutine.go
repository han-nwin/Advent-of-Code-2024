**Prompt**: I have a for loop iterate through each line of an input, how to make every iteration run concurrently in GO

**Assistant**: To run iterations concurrently in Go, you can use goroutines, which are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. When processing lines from an input concurrently, it's often helpful to use channels to coordinate the work between goroutines and the main function. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"sync"
)

func processLine(line string, wg *sync.WaitGroup, id int) {
	defer wg.Done()
	// Your line processing logic here
	fmt.Printf("Goroutine %d is processing: %s\n", id, line)
}

func main() {
	file, err := os.Open("input.txt")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
	var wg sync.WaitGroup

	goroutineID := 0
	for scanner.Scan() {
		line := scanner.Text()
		wg.Add(1)

		go func(line string, id int) {
			processLine(line, &wg, id)
		}(line, goroutineID)

		goroutineID++
	}

	// Wait for all goroutines to finish
	wg.Wait()

	if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
	}
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **File Reading**:
   - We use `bufio.NewScanner` to read the input file line by line.

2. **Concurrency**:
   - For each line, a goroutine is spawned using the `go` keyword.
   - `wg.Add(1)` increments the WaitGroup counter for each goroutine.

3. **Synchronization**:
   - The `processLine` function performs the actual processing and calls `wg.Done()` when finished to signal that this goroutine's work is done.
   - `wg.Wait()` is used in the main function to wait for all goroutines to complete.

4. **Variables**:
   - Note how the `line` variable and `goroutineID` are passed as arguments to the goroutine function to avoid issues with variable capturing in loopsâ€”a common pitfall.

This pattern ensures that all lines are processed concurrently, and the main function waits for all goroutine executions to complete before proceeding. Adjust the `processLine` function according to your specific line processing logic.
